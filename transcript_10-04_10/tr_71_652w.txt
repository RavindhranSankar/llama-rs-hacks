DR. JONES: Good morning, Mrs. Sanders. How are you feeling today?

MRS. SANDERS: Morning, Dr. Jones. Not very well, if I'm being honest.

DR. JONES: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you explain a bit more about your discomfort?

MRS. SANDERS: I've had constant headaches for the past two weeks. My sleep is disrupted, I lack concentration, and every day tasks are becoming difficult. 

DR. JONES: I understand. Sorry to learn about the stress you've been under. Headaches can be debilitating. Let's see, in these past two weeks, have these headaches been constant, or do they occur at specific times?

MRS. SANDERS: Mostly constant, but they tend to get worse in the afternoon, especially if it's been a stressful day.

DR. JONES: Have you noticed any signs of blurred vision or discomfort in the eyes? 

MRS. SANDERS: Not particularly. Expect for the fact that I feel a bit sensitive to light, but no, I don't think my vision is a problem.

DR. JONES: How about your appetite or any weight changes?

MRS. SANDERS: Frankly, I've lost a bit of appetite over the past week. And yes, I suppose my weight has decreased a little.

DR. JONES: Any signs of fever, nausea, or stiffness in the neck?

MRS. SANDERS: No fever, but yes, a bit of nausea. And the past few days, my neck’s been so tense. I attributed it to bad posture or stress, but perhaps it’s related.

DR. JONES: These symptoms may hint towards migraines, or certain stress-tension headaches. But let's not jump to conclusions, it's crucial to carry out some tests first. Mrs. Sanders, do you have any history of migraines in your family?

MRS. SANDERS: Yes, my mother used to suffer from migraines.

DR. JONES: I see. That's an important piece of information. We'll take note. To rule out other potential medical conditions, I would suggest getting a Complete Blood Count (CBC) Test, a blood pressure checkup, a sleep study, and an eye test for intraocular pressure. Let's also do an MRI scan to be completely sure it's not anything serious.

MRS. SANDERS: That sounds like a lot, Dr. Jones. But whatever's necessary, I suppose.

DR. JONES: I understand it's not easy, Mrs. Sanders. But we must dig deeper to figure out the root cause. For now, I would suggest you maintain a headache diary. Pen down when your headache starts, where the pain is, how severe it is, any foods you ate, what you were doing, and how long it lasts. 

MRS. SANDERS: I'll do that, Dr. Jones. 

DR. JONES: In addition, we must aim to manage your stress levels. Can you tell me more about your lifestyle? Eating habits, physical activity, alcohol, tobacco intake?

MRS. SANDERS: I try to eat healthily, but with office work, I occasionally rely on takeout. I don't exercise regularly–maybe once a week. I don't smoke, and as for alcohol, I may have a glass of wine or two over the weekend.

DR. JONES: It's essential that you start to add more exercise into your routine. Even 30 minutes of brisk walking can do wonders. Try to include fresh fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains in your diet. This will not only improve your overall health but will also help control stress levels. Remember to stay hydrated as well.

MRS. SANDERS: I'll try to follow your advice, Dr. Jones.

DR. JONES: That's wonderful, Mrs. Sanders. We'll start a mild pain relief for your immediate headache symptoms. But remember, these are temporary fixes. The lab tests will offer more clarity on the cause of the headaches, and accordingly, we may alter or continue with your medication.

MRS. SANDERS: I understand, Dr. Jones.

DR. JONES: I'll see you again next week after we've gathered the test results. We'll discuss further steps then.

MRS. SANDERS: Thank you for your time, Dr. Jones.

DR. JONES: Always here to help, Mrs. Sanders. Please schedule your test appointments with Jessica at the front desk. Remember to get plenty of rest and try to stay as stress-free as possible.
