 Sure, here is the SOAP note for the given transcript:
Subjective:
* Frequent headaches and occasional bouts of dizziness
Objective:
* Headaches started 6 weeks ago, progressed from once or twice a week to nearly every day
* Dizziness started 2 weeks ago, occurs when standing up quickly after a period of rest or after a long time of sitting
* Pain is dull, throbbing, and becomes a steady sensation as intensity increases
* Blurred vision, weakness, and difficulty speaking sometimes occur during particularly severe headaches

Assessment:
* Headaches and dizziness could be related to high stress levels and inadequate sleep
* Need to rule out other potential medical issues through tests such as Complete Blood Count, MRI of the brain, or EEG

Plan:
* Arrange for blood work to be done today at the clinic
* Refer Mr. Johnson to a diagnostic center for MRI and EEG, with results to be reviewed once received
* Encourage Mr. Johnson to manage stress levels, ensure adequate rest, and reduce caffeine intake until tests are completed
* Schedule follow-up appointment for review of test results and next steps.
