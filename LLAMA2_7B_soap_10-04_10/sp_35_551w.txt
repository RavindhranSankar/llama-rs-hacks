Assessment:
Based on the patient's symptoms, it is possible that they have an underlying medical condition that is causing their symptoms. The patient's history of high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes increases the likelihood of an underlying condition. The patient's recent stress at work may also be contributing to their symptoms.
Plan:

1. Order a complete blood count and a thyroid function test to rule out any underlying medical conditions.
2. Recommend relaxation exercises such as deep breathing, meditation, and establishing a regular sleep schedule to manage stress and improve sleep.
3. Monitor the patient's symptoms and adjust the treatment plan as needed based on the test results.
4. Schedule a follow-up appointment to review the test results and discuss any necessary next steps.
