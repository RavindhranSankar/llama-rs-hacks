 Subjective:
* Headaches (almost every day)
* Fatigue (fairly constant throughout the day)
* Blurred vision (to some extent)
* Difficulty falling asleep (sometimes)

Objective:
* Patient has been experiencing headaches, fatigue, and blurred vision for approximately five days.
* Headaches occur almost every day and are accompanied by blurred vision to some extent.
* Fatigue is fairly constant throughout the day.
* Patient has difficulty falling asleep sometimes due to headaches.

Assessment:
* Headaches and blurred vision are likely caused by an underlying medical condition such as Hypothyroidism, Vitamin deficiencies, or Diabetes.
* Fatigue could be due to stress, work-related factors, or an underlying medical condition.

Plan:
* Carry out complete blood count, thyroid function test, Vitamin D and B12 levels, and blood glucose levels to rule out underlying medical conditions.
* Schedule a vision test to determine if the headaches are caused by eye strain or a need for corrective lenses.
* Provide over-the-counter pain medication for headaches until the real cause is identified.
* Encourage the patient to eat well, get enough sleep, and take breaks during work to manage stress.
* Schedule a follow-up appointment once the test results are available to establish a comprehensive treatment plan tailored specifically to the patient's needs.
