Objective:
* The patient presents with a history of intense headaches for the last couple of weeks.
* The patient's vital signs are normal.
* The patient's physical examination is within normal limits.
* The patient's neurological examination is normal.

Assessment:
* The patient's symptoms suggest a possibility of tension headaches due to stress at work.
* The patient's history of not identifying any specific triggers for the headaches supports this diagnosis.
* The patient's normal vital signs and physical examination rule out any serious underlying conditions.

Plan:
* Run a series of tests, including a physical examination and if needed, an MRI, to rule out anything serious.
* Advice the patient to reduce his stress levels – maybe take up yoga or meditation – and ensure that he maintains a regular sleeping schedule.
* Discuss potential treatments once the tests are complete and the results are known.
