 Subjective:
The patient, a 35-year-old male, presented with a one-week history of persistent lower back discomfort. The pain is described as a dull ache, which becomes more evident at the end of the day. The patient has not experienced any sharp or stinging pain and has not noticed any tingling or numbness in their legs. The patient engages in regular weightlifting at the gym five times a week but has not done anything out of the ordinary. The patient's posture is generally good, but they do sit for extended periods at work.
Objective:
The patient reported experiencing a dull ache in their lower back, which has persisted for one week. The pain is not overly painful but is causing some concern. The patient has not experienced any significant strength loss or other symptoms. The patient's posture is generally good but may be exacerbating the discomfort.
Assessment:
Based on the patient's symptoms, it is likely that the patient is experiencing muscular strain due to heavy lifting. However, it is important to rule out any other potential causes, such as spinal disc issues or nerve involvement, through imaging and further evaluation. The patient's regular exercise routine and good posture may be contributing to the discomfort.
Plan:
1. Order imaging studies to rule out any underlying spinal disc issues or nerve involvement.
2. Prescribe a muscle relaxant to help manage the patient's dull ache.
3. Advise the patient to take short, frequent breaks during work to improve posture and reduce discomfort.
4. Encourage the patient to continue with their regular exercise routine, but to be mindful of their posture and avoid heavy lifting until further evaluation is complete.
