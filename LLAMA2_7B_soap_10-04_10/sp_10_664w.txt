 Subjective:
* The patient has been experiencing fatigue and sporadic bouts of dizziness for the past couple of days.
Objective:
* The patient has been feeling unwell for the past couple of days, with fatigue most of the day despite sleeping for about seven hours each night, and dizziness that occurs suddenly, lasts for a couple of minutes, and then disappears.
* The patient has noticed that the fatigue and dizziness are worse in the morning and afternoon, respectively.
* The patient has been experiencing a slight headache and a little sadness, but nothing major in that regard.
* The patient has been drinking enough water, but perhaps not enough.
* The patient has been working quite hard lately and hasnâ€™t taken the time to eat properly or exercise regularly, which could be contributing to some of the stress.

Assessment:
* The patient's symptoms are consistent with anemia, hypoglycemia, or dehydration.
* The patient's mental health is also a concern, as they have been feeling a little down and stressed.

Plan:
* Order a complete blood count test, thyroid function test, and glucose level check to rule out any potential medical causes for the patient's symptoms.
* Encourage the patient to eat well, hydrate, exercise, and take care of their mental health.
* Arrange for the patient to see a mental health professional if their sadness persists or intensifies.
* Schedule the patient for a follow-up appointment in a week to discuss the test results and provide further guidance.
