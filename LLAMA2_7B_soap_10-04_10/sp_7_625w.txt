Subjective:
* Patient, Tom, is a 45-year-old male who presents with a week-long history of general tiredness and decreased appetite.
* He reports no fever, cough, or pain, but notes that he has recently changed his job, which may be contributing to his symptoms.
* Tom also mentions that he has been feeling down lately, possibly due to increased stress.

Objective:
* Patient appears alert and oriented, with a normal temperature and blood pressure.
* Physical examination reveals no obvious signs of illness, such as tachycardia or tachypnea.
* Tom's heart rate is regular, and his blood pressure is normal.

Assessment:
* Based on the patient's symptoms and medical history, it is possible that he is experiencing a stress-related condition, such as burnout or depression.
* The recent job change may be contributing to his symptoms, and it is important to rule out any underlying physical conditions that could be causing his fatigue and loss of appetite.
* Tom's family history of heart disease also warrants further evaluation.

Plan:
* Order a comprehensive blood work-up to rule out any physical conditions that may be contributing to Tom's symptoms.
* Schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the test results and develop a plan for further evaluation and management.
* Encourage Tom to engage in stress-reducing activities, such as exercise, relaxation techniques, or counseling, to help manage his stress and improve his overall well-being.
