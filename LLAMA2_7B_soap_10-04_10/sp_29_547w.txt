 Subjective:
* Fatigue (constant, hard to get out of bed in the morning)
* Headaches (occur at the front of the head, force and intensity vary, come suddenly, no specific pattern)
* Nausea (twice over the weekend after headaches)

Objective:
* Patient has been experiencing fatigue and headaches for the past week
* Fatigue is constant throughout the day and headaches come suddenly without warning
* Patient has tried to maintain a healthy diet, exercise routine, and no new medications have been taken

Assessment:
* Fatigue and headaches could be related to a variety of factors, including viral or bacterial infections, chronic fatigue syndrome, or a side effect of medication.
* Further testing, such as a full blood count, liver and kidney function test, and thyroid function test, will be necessary to determine the cause of the patient's symptoms.

Plan:
* Order full blood count, liver and kidney function test, and thyroid function test to rule out any underlying conditions that could be causing the fatigue and headaches.
* Discuss possible treatment options with the patient once the test results are available.
* Encourage patient to call the clinic if they have any other concerns or if their symptoms worsen.
