Objective:
* The patient has been experiencing frequent headaches for the past two weeks.
* The patient has noticed that the headaches occur when they are working on their computer or reading for long periods.
* The patient has tried taking ibuprofen, which dulls the pain but does not completely go away.

Assessment:
* Based on the patient's symptoms, it is possible that they are experiencing tension-type headaches, which are triggered by stress, poor posture, and eye strain.
* However, it is important to rule out other potential causes, such as infection, high blood pressure, or issues with blood sugar, through further testing.

Plan:
* Continue taking ibuprofen when needed to dull the pain.
* Reduce screen time and manage stress.
* Improve posture while reading or using the computer.
* Gradually decrease caffeine consumption.
* Keep track of when the headaches occur and what the patient is doing at the time.
* Schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to review symptoms and test results.
* If needed, get an MRI scan done to further rule out other potential causes.
